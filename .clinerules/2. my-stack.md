It's a tiktok app that helps user to monitor a group of their channel and handles scheduled video uploading

- Use React 19 and react-router 7.1.5
- use Chart.js to render chart 
- the project use file based router but is hybrid mode with Tabs (in src/Tabs) and Page (in src/pages)
  - main app flow should be in Tabs
  - pages requires external link sharing (e.g legal doc or callback url) are in pages
- for ui component, use styled-components to build most of the wediget unless it's too complicated (e.g job handled by chart.js). But ask user and explain why we need a third party before install it
